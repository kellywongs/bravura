*a sheet music transcribing app that doesn't suck*

## concept
+ **one-handed controls**: One thumb should be able to write a whole line of music without leaving the screen. 
+ Note Values
  + The staff is sized appropriately to be within range of the thumb. It has to be large enough for clarity, yet small enough for control.
  + Notes can be written by tapping on a line or space, or dragging a note up and down to be able to access chromatics. 
  + If you're approaching a note from the top, it will suggest sharps; if you're approaching it from the bottom you'll get flats. Depending on the key signature, you'll also find naturals. 
    + TODO: List of behaviors of sharps/flats/naturals for different key signatures
  + Instant auditory feedback a la Noteflight. (See Noises.)
  + *3D Touch capabilites:* Hard-pressing (or long-pressing, depending on device) a note will bring up a control panel of articulation markings that can be further customized in Settings. These don't count crescendos/decrescendos, dynamic markings, slurs, etc; rather, they're focused on the individual note.
    + examples: dotted half (!), tenuto, stacatto, accents, up/down bows, harmonics if you're into that kinda thing, tremelo.
    + organized by type of instrument (bowed, strummed, blown, tapped)? bowed -> up/down 
    + TODO: Look up articulations specifically for 
+ Note Length
